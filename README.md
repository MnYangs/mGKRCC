## Codes for Multi-neighborhood Guided Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient for Feature Matching
We propose a multi-neighborhood Guided Kendall Rank Correlation Coefficient algorithm (mGKRCC). We use neighborhood vectors constructed by feature points and their neighborhood points to characterize the structures of their neighborhoods, which can rationally integrate the distance and direction information and make full use of the geometric information of local neighborhood structures.
